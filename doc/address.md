# Exploit your address

Get more control from your account address using "+" and "." symbols.

Suppose your e-mail address is

>       myaddress@gmail.com

Then, the following addresses will be interpreted as your e-mail account as well

>       my.address@gmail.com
>       myaddress.foo@gmail.com 
>       myaddress+foo@gmail.com

This simple feature proves to be very powerful when administering your e-mail.

## Suffixes

My strategy looks something like this

>   <font color="grey">myadress+</font>suffix1<font color="grey">+</font>suffix2<font color="grey">+</font>suffix3<font color="grey">@gmail.com</font>

The first suffix I use is to indicate the origin of the e-mail


| Origin        | Suffix 1  |
| :---:         | :---:     |
| Argentina     | +arg      |
| United Stated | +us       |


The second suffix I use is to indicate the category to which it belongs


| Category      | Example   | Suffix 2          |
| :---:         | :---:     | :---:             |
| Bank          | Chase     | +bank             |
| Credit card   | Discover  | +credit-card      |
| Investment    | Robinhood | +investment       |
| Utilities     | Internet  | +utilities        |
| Education     | College   | +education        |
| Work          | Company   | +work             |
| Shopping      | Amazon    | +shopping         |
| Car dealer    | CarMax    | +car-dealer       |
| Travel        | Booking   | +travel           |
| Social media  | Instagram | +social-media     |
| Entertainment | Netflix   | +entertainment    |
| Memberships   | IEEE      | +membership       |
| Miscellaneous | Apps      | +miscellaneous    |

The third suffix I ocassionally use is a very specific descriptor


| Descriptor                        | Suffix 3          |
| :---:                             | :---:             |
| Company I'm working for           | +*work_id*        |
| University program I'm studying   | +*college_id*     |
| Membership identifier             | +*membership_id*  |

**NOTE:** *work_id*, *membership_id* and *college_id* could be numbers or names or whatever you want.

## Labels and Filters

Finally, you can [organize your mailbox using labels](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/how-to-master-gmails-advanced-search-and-labelling). For example, create a label for each **category** and then set a filter to automatically store all your incoming e-mails to the address having the necessary suffix.
